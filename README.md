### Background

Hello!

My name is Nikolai Baranov, welcome to my portfolio! A little bit about me. I am 3rd year undergarduate student in HSE. My major is Business Administration. During my education I realised the value of robust data analysis for business and took an interest in Data Science/Analytics in order to explore this topic further. Over the years I accumulated skill and knowledge in this field and used them for my curiosity's sake as well as for educational purposes. I am looking forward to applying my skills for real business tasks.

I enjoy searching for "ground truth" with different methods and seek expertize, experience, mentoring and collaboration in the field of Data Science/Analysis. Although, I admit that analysis attracts me the most.
